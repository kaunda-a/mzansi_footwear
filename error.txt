The review functionality has been partially implemented with the following components:

1. Created API routes for handling reviews:
   - GET /api/products/[productId]/reviews - Fetch reviews for a product
   - POST /api/products/[productId]/reviews - Create a new review
   - POST /api/reviews/[reviewId] - Mark a review as helpful/not helpful

2. Created ReviewService to handle review operations

3. Updated the Prisma schema to include helpful/notHelpful fields for reviews

However, the database migration could not be run due to connection issues. Once the database is accessible, you'll need to run:
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_helpful_fields_to_reviews

After that, the review functionality should work properly for logged-in customers.
