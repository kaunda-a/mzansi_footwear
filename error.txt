The filter component issue has been resolved by implementing proper client-server architecture:

1. Updated ProductFilters component to fetch filter options (categories, brands, sizes, colors) from the existing API endpoint (/api/filters)
2. Removed hardcoded filter options and replaced with dynamic data from the database
3. Added loading states for better user experience
4. Improved error handling for price range parameters
5. Added product counts to filter options for better UX
6. Enhanced color display with actual color swatches
7. Removed unnecessary Suspense wrapper in ProductsPage


The component now properly follows the client-server pattern used throughout the application, where:
- Server-side API routes provide data through /api/filters
- Client-side components fetch and display this data
- URL parameters are properly handled for all filter types (size, color, price range, categories, brands)

This resolves the client-side exception that was occurring when navigating to URLs like /products?size=9
